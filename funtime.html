                    Bonnie the Rabbit is one of the four original animatronics of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and a major antagonist in the Five Nights at Freddy's series.
                    Bonnie is an animatronic rabbit and the guitarist in Freddy's band, positioned at the left side of the stage. Undisclosed to Fazbear Entertainment, Inc. and the public, Bonnie is heavily implied to be possessed by the restless spirit of Jeremy – a little boy murdered by William Afton. Due to this, he and the others are now seeking revenge against their killer by attacking any adults in the pizzeria after-hours in a blind rage.
                    He was the guitarist when the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was opened in 1983, though, just like Freddy, it is heavily implied that he had already existed as a character for many years, if not decades, prior to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. In 1987, he and the original animatronics had all fallen into severe disrepair and were put under attempted retrofit before being replaced by his newer counterpart for the "improved" Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, Toy Bonnie.After the pizzeria's closing, he and the original animatronics were refurbished for the new pizzeria, as of the events of the first game. However, after the closure of the new pizzeria, he and the other animatronics got dismantled by their killer. His soul, along with the others, was presumably set free, as evidenced by the good ending.
