                    Shadow Bonnie, also known as RWQFSFASXC, is a enigmatic, hallucinatory entity from the *Five Nights at Freddy's* franchise, manifesting as a supernatural "shadow remnant" born from the series' dark history of tragedies like the Missing Children Incident in 1985 or the Bite of '87. This spectral rabbit appears as a pitch-black silhouette resembling Toy Bonnie, with long floppy ears, a slender muzzle, glowing white eyes (lacking pupils), sharp white teeth, and subtle purple outlines, standing at an estimated height of about 6'0" (1.83 m). It has a glitchy, intangible form, often depicted in flat 8-bit style in minigames, and lacks any physical presence or ownership by Fazbear Entertainment—it's not a traditional animatronic but a free-roaming apparition tied to emotional "agony" from unresolved suffering. Behaviorally, Shadow Bonnie emerges rarely as a hallucination in dimly lit areas, causing system glitches, distortions, or outright game crashes (as seen in *FNAF 2* where staring at it crashes the game), and it can phase through environments to induce fear without direct aggression. In the lore, it's speculated to represent a tormented victim's spirit or guilt linked to the Afton family, playing a redemptive role in *FNAF 3* minigames by helping free the souls of murdered children through hidden stages. It first appeared in *Five Nights at Freddy's 2* as a rare office easter egg, with subsequent roles in *Ultimate Custom Night* (darkening the screen), *Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted* (glitching into VR), and *Five Nights at Freddy's AR: Special Delivery* as a shadowy foe, making it a persistent symbol of the franchise's supernatural underbelly.
