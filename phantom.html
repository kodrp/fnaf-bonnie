                   Phantom Bonnie is a haunting, hallucinatory apparition from the *Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, specifically debuting as one of the phantom animatronics in *Five Nights at Freddy's 3*, where it embodies the distorted remnants of the original Bonnie character twisted by fire and psychological terror in the decrepit Fazbear's Fright horror attraction. This spectral entity manifests during ventilation failures or low oxygen levels, triggered by the environment's faulty systems, and is tied to the lingering trauma of the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza tragedies, including the Missing Children Incident and the subsequent fires that ravaged the locations. Appearing as a severely burnt and decayed version of the classic purple Bonnie rabbit, Phantom Bonnie features a charred, greenish-black exoskeleton with exposed wiring, melted fur, hollow black eye sockets glowing with eerie white pupils, jagged teeth in a perpetual grin, and tattered ears that droop limply, giving it a grotesque, zombie-like silhouette standing at roughly 6'2" (1.88 m) tall, though its hallucinatory nature makes it seem distorted and larger-than-life in the player's panicked vision. Unlike the possessed animatronics, Phantom Bonnie is intangible and non-lethal, but it aggressively jumpscares the player by suddenly appearing in vents, doorways, or monitors, causing system errors like audio malfunctions or camera blackouts that hinder survival without direct physical harm—it's more of a psychological tormentor, exacerbating paranoia in the already tense atmosphere of the game. In the lore, it's interpreted as a manifestation of the guard's deteriorating mental state or a ghostly echo of the original Bonnie suit, which was destroyed in a fire after being haunted by a child's spirit, possibly amplified by the vengeful presence of Springtrap (William Afton) in the same building; some theories link it to the "phantom" remnants of agony from the franchise's murders. Phantom Bonnie first menaced players in *Five Nights at Freddy's 3* as a ventilation-induced hallucination, with cameo-like returns in *Ultimate Custom Night* (as a customizable foe that disables doors), *Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted* (in VR recreations of FNAF 3 levels), and subtle references in books and spin-offs, solidifying its role as a symbol of the series' themes of decay, guilt, and inescapable horror from past sins.
