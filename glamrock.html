                    Glamrock Bonnie, also known as just Bonnie, was a glamrock counterpart of Bonnie who was mentioned in Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach and made an official appearance in the RUIN DLC.
                    He was the former bassist of the Glamrock Band inside of Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex before being put "out of commission" for unknown reasons and replaced by Montgomery Gator. In Security Breach, he doesn't physically appear throughout the entire main game, with his existence mostly being hinted via mentions. According to an employee log, many kids asked where Bonnie was, leading the Pizzaplex staff to remove references to Bonnie from the location. Despite this, kids were still asking about Bonnie, so the staff had been considering re-theming his bowling alley. In a security report log, it is stated that Bonnie was last seen entering the Gator Golf course.
