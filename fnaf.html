        <h3 class="left jolly-lodger-regular glow-red">Origin:</h3>
        <p class="left jolly-lodger-regular fancy-red p">He was the guitarist when the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was opened in 1983,
             though, just like Freddy, it is heavily implied that he had already existed as a character for many years, if not decades,
              prior to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. In 1987, he and the original animatronics had all fallen into severe disrepair and was put
               under attempted retrofit before being replaced by his newer counterpart for the "improved" Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, Toy Bonnie.
                After the pizzeria's closing, he and the original animatronics were refurbished for the new pizzeria, as of the events of the
                 first game. However, after the closure of the new pizzeria, he and the other animatronics got dismantled by their killer.
                  His soul, along with the others, was presumably set free, as evidenced by the good ending.</p>
                  <h3 class="left jolly-lodger-regular glow-red">Description</h3>
                  <p class="left jolly-lodger-regular fancy-red p">Bonnie is an animatronic rabbit and the guitarist in Freddy's band, positioned
                     at the left side of the stage. Undisclosed to Fazbear Entertainment, Inc. and the public, Bonnie is heavily implied to be possessed 
                     by the restless spirit of Jeremy – a little boy murdered by William Afton. Due to this, he and the others are now seeking revenge against
                      their killer by attacking any adults in the pizzeria after-hours in a blind rage.</p>
