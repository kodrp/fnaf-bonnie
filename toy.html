                        Among the various redesigns, Toy Bonnie exhibits the most significant transformations, aside from Mangle. He features a vibrant, glossy blue hue, with his belly, snout, and inner ears in a soft, light blue shade. His eyes are green, accompanied by purple eyelids, extended eyelashes, and vivid red, flushed cheeks. Additionally, he possesses a white, round tail that's only visible during his crawl through the Right Air Vent. Unlike the classic Bonnie, he includes eyebrows and bears no visual resemblance to Toy Freddy.
                        Similar to the other updated versions, Toy Bonnie has a much sleeker surface texture than the original animatronics. He boasts a contemporary design with flexible, multi-segmented fingers and a rigid shell, in contrast to the cloth exteriors of the earlier models. Toy Bonnie is adorned with a red bow tie, a black button-like nose, whisker markings, and prominent front teeth, evoking the image of a typical cartoon rabbit—distinct from his predecessor. His eyes seem capable of independent movement. In an eerie fashion, his pupils shrink as he draws nearer to the player.
