    <h1 class="center">My History with Five Nights at Freddy's</h1>
    <p>Back in 2014 when Five Nights at Freddy's came out I was 6 years old. I got a video of Markiplier recommended on YouTube and even though I didn't understand English at the time I was hooked. I watched all his videos of FNAF and patienlty waited for new ones to come out. In elementary school I met a guy who was also a big FNAF fan and for the entyire time of elementary school we were only talking about FNAF and imiliar indie horror games. During the years more games released and everytime another one came out I immediatly bought it. Watching Markiplier and other horror YouTubers in general helped me learn English pretty fast. After some time I decided that Bonnie is my favorite animatronic. In my opinion hes often overlooked. 2023 when the first movie came out I was hyped. I always wondered how the story of the game would be in real life and the movie visualized it perfectly. Now as of December 06th 2025 I just watched the second FNAF movie and it was, again, amazing. Finally seeing the puppet in action and the mask mechanic being shown was so good. I still play everything that has something to do with Five Nights at Freddy's and I'm hyped for the third movie, which will be about Springtrap.</p>

        How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
        He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, and chuck as much wood
